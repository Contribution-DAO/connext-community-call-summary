#### 2017
Connext team have jumped into the blockchain space and have been BUIDLing since 2017. "We built Connext because we want to bring blockchains to the broader comsumer public. This is something that people hadn't even begun to think about. The ETH price was around 20-30 USD at the time", said Arjun. This is the question that leads to the thesis of **blockchain scalability**.

#### 2018
With the goal of solving **blockchain scalability**, the team became one of the first L2 R&D Team. Arjun and the team have built the first layer-2 on Ethereum, which was the [State Channel Networks](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/state-channels/) designed for payments. Later, the team have worked with other L2 teams such as OmiseGO team, Matic team.

#### 2020
In 2020, the community the market started to realized that Roll-ups were going to be the future of scalability. At this point, Connext team saw that communication between  is necessary and have built a very first Arbitrum-Optimism bridge called [Spacefold](https://github.com/connext/spacefold) as a POC. This is the very first trust-minimized cross-chain bridge for rollups.
