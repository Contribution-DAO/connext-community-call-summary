#### 2017
Connext team have jumped into the blockchain space and have been BUIDLing since 2017. "We built Connext because we want to bring blockchains to the broader comsumer public. This is something that people hadn't even begun to think about. The ETH price was around 20-30 USD at the time", said Arjun. This is the question that leads to the thesis of **blockchain scalability**.

#### 2018
With the goal of solving **blockchain scalability**, the team became one of the first L2 R&D Team. Arjun and the team have built the first layer-2 on Ethereum, which was the [State Channel Networks](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/state-channels/) designed for payments. Later, the team have worked with other L2 teams such as OmiseGO team, Matic team.

#### 2020
In 2020, the community the market started to realized that Roll-ups were going to be the future of scalability. At this point, Connext team saw that communication between  is necessary and have built a very first Arbitrum-Optimism bridge called [Spacefold](https://github.com/connext/spacefold) as a POC. This is the very first trust-minimized cross-chain bridge for rollups.

By the end of 2020, the team have built the early implementation of scalability solution targeted for payment that can do cross-chain transfer called [Vector](https://github.com/connext/vector). The team have worked with many projects in the ecosystem. Around this time, the team have been collaborating with [1Hive](https://1hive.org/) have built a POC bridge that later become **xpollinate** (The old name of Connext Bridge, read more [here](https://blog.connext.network/xpollinate-is-now-connext-bridge-d294baea94c2)).

#### 2021
Later in 2021, the team were able to ship NXTP, which is a more stable implementation of the network. At that time, the NXTP is quite unstable, most assumption on liveliness of routers, stability, etc. are incorrect. This cause the team to take more that a year for the upcoming upgrade to the network. This new updates will solve the existed issues, and even improve the stability as well as allows generalized communication among chains.

#### 2022
That update is the Amarok upgrade 🐺

<details open><summary> <b>🤔 Why Connext?</b> </summary>

> _this session was moderated by [Arjun](https://twitter.com/arjunbhuptani)_

There're key principles that Connext helped shape how Connext is. The very first key principle in designing Connext Network was the **Security**

> 🔒 Security

The team focus on the security as the first priority and have been doing this for 5 years of building Connext.

One of the key realization is that the Web3 space move very quickly that it's not a good idea to bet on any single structure of security model. Thus, this lead us to the second and third principle which are **Modularity**, **Extensibility**, and **Future-Proof**

> 🧩 Modularity<br>
🔌 Extensibility<br>
📡 Future-Proof

_Modularity_ allows the design of infrastrusture to composed of different module that is easy to plug-in and plug-out. This allows the network to be able to adapt with the new technology and robust to changes.

_Composability_ is the key principle that make Connext easily integrated with different blockchains with minimal effort. The future of Connext is to build a xApps that would live on multiple chains. The concept of how users acknowledge which chains they're on would be removed.

The last key value of Connext is the **Ease of Implementation**

> 🌈 Ease of Implementation

The _Ease of Implementation_ for Connext allows the experience of building on Connext seamless.
